          <h4>What is a poegram?</h4> 
          <p>Here we are presenting random lines of poets of note. One can choose an author or allow them to be randomly chosen. Even if one chooses an author then a random poem and line will be chosen from that author. What is returned is a line on a field of color.</p>
          <p>The phenomena of concepts, whether positive or negative, come about due to the influence of what is a process of interdependent mental connection. the respective causes and conditions of these phenomena  come together quite adventitiously and act on one another. No matter how these limitless thoughts and associations manifest in all their variety, as distinct causes and results, it is ordinary conceptual consciousness that imposes order on, or arranges, all such thoughts and possibilities.</p>
          <p>When you see the line for the first time, mind will immediatly start to make an association with the line. The mental response will be one of indifference, or an association with a memory, an experience, an attraction to the words, or a dismissive emotion that pushes the away any meaning that might arise from the line. This, as stated before, is because mind makes order out of the randomness of the world.  We encourage you to watch your mind as random lines appear and how mind reacts to them. Appreciate the qualities of the words, and appreciate your own mental reaction to the words.</p>
          <p>While we engaged in a project of creating code that could present this experience to you, it was our sincere wish that we were also creating a tool for reflection, appreciation, contemplation, or even casual divination. This is what a poegram is. A <em>tabula rasa</em>, so to speak, for you to experience, write, and share with the world.</p>
